// 1) Creating and nesting components

// what is compenent ?
// React apps are made out of components. A component is a piece of the UI (user interface) that has its own logic and appearance. A component can be as small as a button, or as large as an entire page.

// React components are JavaScript functions that return markup
function MyButton() {
  return (
    <button>I'm a button</button>
  );
}
// Now that you’ve declared MyButton, you can nest it into another component
export default function MyApp() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Welcome to my app</h1>
      <MyButton />
    </div>
  );
}
// Notice that <MyButton /> starts with a capital letter. That’s how you know it’s a React component. React component names must always start with a capital letter, while HTML tags must be lowercase.
// Now Our App.js code will be 

function MyButton() {
  return (
    <button>
      I'm a button
    </button>
  );
}
export default function MyApp() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Welcome to my app</h1>
      <MyButton />
    </div>
  );
}

//2)Writing markup with JSX 
//The markup syntax you’ve seen above is called JSX.

//JSX is stricter than HTML. You have to close tags like <br />. Your component also can’t return multiple JSX tags. You have to wrap them into a shared parent, //like a <div>...</div> or an empty <>...</> wrapper
